Write simple "Hello World" code using python, take a single screenshot showing your code and the output, and submit.

If you show only the code without output, you'll get 1

If you show only the output without code, you get 1

If you show nothing, you get 0

If you show both the code and output, you get 2

 

Good Luck!
